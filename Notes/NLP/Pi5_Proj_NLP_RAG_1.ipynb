            "1. Definition and criteria for sepsis: Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response to an infection, with signs of organ dysfunction (e.g., altered mental status, respiratory failure, hypotension). Criteria for diagnosis include suspected or confirmed infection, signs of organ dysfunction, and laboratory evidence of systemic inflammation (e.g., elevated white blood cell count, elevated serum lactate).\n",
            "2. Diagnostic tests: Laboratory studies may include complete blood counts, blood cultures, and serum biomarkers (e.g., procalcitonin, lactate). Imaging studies such as chest X-rays or CT scans may be used to evaluate the extent of infection and organ dysfunction.\n",
            "3. Management protocol: The general principles of management for sepsis include early recognition, prompt administration of antibiotics and fluid resuscitation, and close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values. Vasopressors may be used to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥65 mmHg.\n",
            "4. Monitoring and follow-up: Patients with sepsis should be closely monitored for signs of deterioration or improvement, including changes in vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical status. Escalation of care may be necessary if there is no improvement within 24-48 hours of initiating treatment.\n",
            "5. Complications and sequelae: Potential complications of sepsis include acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, and cardiovascular dysfunction. Long-term sequelae may include cognitive impairment, muscle wasting, and decreased immune function.\n",
            "6. Prognosis and mortality: The prognosis for sepsis varies depending on the underlying cause of the infection, the severity of organ dysfunction, and other individual factors. Mortality rates for sepsis are high, with an estimated 20-30% mortality rate in severe cases.\n",
            "7. Prevention: Strategies to prevent sepsis include early recognition and treatment of infections, prompt administration of antibiotics, proper hand hygiene, and vaccination against infections such as pneumococcal pneumonia.\n",
            "8. Recovery and rehabilitation: The recovery process for patients who have survived sepsis may involve intensive care unit (ICU) stay, mechanical ventilation, and physical therapy to address any lingering effects of the illness. Rehabilitation may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy as needed.\n",

        "-  n_gpu_layers=23 this parameter again shifts most of the computing tasks to GPU and we will have fine tune this parameter to suit your GPU core and memory. Multiple fine tuning has been made from -1 to 43, -1 for CPU compute. And finally achieved GPU layer of 23 which did not make my session go crashing.\n",

        " - Lots of other learning when switching to Gemini API, but the only concern in using it is - cannot be fine tunned with LLM parameters\n",
        " - n_ctx and n_batch should be rightly choosen while development as both have their own stype in execution\n",
